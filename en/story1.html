      <h2>🌙 A Gentle Bedtime Story</h2>

      <p>Once upon a quiet night,</p>
      <p>When stars twinkled softly and the wind whispered lullabies, there was a little Moon, round and bright, hanging in the sky all alone.</p>

      <p>The Moon watched over the sleeping world below— the sleepy bears in their caves, the cozy kittens curled in baskets, and even the tiny children dreaming in their beds.</p>

      <p>But tonight, the Moon felt a little lonely. He didn’t want to shine. He didn’t want to glow. He just wanted… a hug.</p>

      <p>So the Moon floated a little lower.</p>

      <p>First, he peeked into a forest, where the owls hooted gently.</p>

      <p>"Hello?" said the Moon. "Could someone give me a hug?"</p>

      <p>The owls blinked slowly and said, “Oh sweet Moon, we only flap and fly. But we’ll hoot a happy tune for you.”</p>

      <p>The Moon smiled a little, but he still wished for a hug.</p>

      <p>Next, he drifted over the ocean, where dolphins leaped in silver sparkles.</p>

      <p>"Could someone here hug me?" asked the Moon.</p>

      <p>The dolphins chirped and twirled. “We cannot hug you, Moon,” they sang, “but we’ll splash joyfully for you!”</p>

      <p>The Moon felt warmer, but it wasn’t quite the same as a hug.</p>

      <p>Finally, the Moon floated gently to a quiet village, where a little child was just falling asleep.</p>

      <p>The child looked out the window and saw the Moon, glowing soft and sad.</p>

      <p>Without a word, the child opened their arms wide, hugging the night sky with their little heart.</p>

      <p>The Moon didn’t need to be touched to feel it. The warmth, the love, the quiet kindness— it wrapped around him like a blanket.</p>

      <p>The Moon beamed softly, happier than ever before. He rose back into the sky, full and bright, hugged by love and ready to light up dreams.</p>

      <p><strong>And so,</strong></p>
      <p>the child slept with a smile, and the Moon watched over them — no longer lonely, just loved.</p>

      <p><em>Goodnight, little star. 🌟 The Moon is smiling just for you.</em></p>
