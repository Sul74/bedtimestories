  <h1>🌙 The Sleepy Starlight Village</h1>
  <div class="story">
    <p>Once upon a time, in a hidden valley wrapped in lavender skies and cotton-candy clouds, there was a tiny village called <strong>Starlight Hollow</strong>. This was no ordinary village—it only came alive when the moon rose high, and the stars blinked open their sparkling eyes.</p>

    <p>The houses were shaped like teapots and toadstools, and every rooftop was made of twinkling, soft moss that glowed faintly in the dark. The air always smelled like warm milk and honey, and the breeze hummed lullabies as it passed through the willow trees.</p>

    <p>In this dreamy little place lived a cuddly bear named <strong>Bumble</strong>. Bumble wasn’t a big bear, nor a brave bear, but he was the sleepiest bear you’d ever meet. His fur was as soft as a dandelion puff, and he wore a tiny blue nightcap with golden stars that jingled gently when he walked.</p>

    <p>Bumble had one very special job: he was the <em>Dreamkeeper</em> of Starlight Hollow.</p>

    <p>Every evening, just as the first star twinkled in the sky, Bumble would shuffle out of his teapot house, stretch a big yawn, and say:</p>

    <p class="quote">"Time to collect the dreams!"</p>

    <p>He carried with him a patchwork bag made from moon-silk and cloud-thread, sewn by the fairies of the valley. With it, he floated gently from house to house, gathering sleepy thoughts and dream wishes from each of the village’s cozy creatures.</p>

    <p>At Miss Maple the squirrel’s house, he found dreams of dancing in golden autumn leaves.</p>

    <p>At Tilly Toad’s home, he collected bubbles filled with underwater lullabies.</p>

    <p>At the Snore Fox twins' den, he gathered dreams of floating on jellybean clouds, high above the world.</p>

    <p>Each dream was a tiny glowing bubble, filled with color and music and whispers. Bumble tucked them carefully into his dream bag, humming as he worked.</p>

    <p>When the dream bag was full, Bumble climbed the hill behind the village—<strong>Starfall Hill</strong>, where the sky looked close enough to touch. At the top, he would sit on his favorite mushroom cushion and open the bag wide.</p>

    <p>Out floated the dreams, swirling and spinning, and Bumble would gently blow them up into the sky.</p>

    <p>As they floated higher, they turned into twinkling stars.</p>

    <p><em>That’s why, if you ever look up at the night sky and see a star flicker or a new one appear—it might just be one of Bumble’s dreams, drifting into the heavens.</em></p>

    <p>One night, as Bumble was about to set off on his dream-gathering round, he noticed a little owl sitting on his doorstep. Her feathers were dusty gray with specks of moonlight, and her eyes blinked sleepily.</p>

    <p>“Hello,” she said softly. “I’m <strong>Luna</strong>, and I’ve lost my dream. I can’t sleep without it.”</p>

    <p>Bumble blinked. “Oh dear. That won’t do at all. Come with me—I’ll help you find it.”</p>

    <p>So together they went, padding through the village, peeking into dreams and memories, checking every corner of imagination.</p>

    <p>They looked in the storybook tree, where picture tales grew like leaves.</p>

    <p>They checked the Rainbow Pond, where dream-fish leapt in silver splashes.</p>

    <p>They even asked the giggle gnomes, who only spoke in tickles.</p>

    <p>But still, no dream.</p>

    <p>At last, they reached the top of Starfall Hill. Luna looked very sad. “Maybe I don’t have any dreams left,” she whispered.</p>

    <p>Bumble thought for a moment, then smiled gently. “Maybe,” he said, “your dream isn’t lost. Maybe it’s still waiting to be made.”</p>

    <p>He reached into his bag and pulled out a tiny piece of cloud and a pinch of starlight. He added a droplet of lullaby and a whisper of wonder. Then he handed the tiny shimmering bundle to Luna.</p>

    <p>“Hold it close and close your eyes,” he said.</p>

    <p>Luna did as he told her—and suddenly, her feathers sparkled, her eyelids grew heavy, and a dreamy smile curled on her beak.</p>

    <p>She nestled beside Bumble, and together they watched the stars dance.</p>

    <p>And just like that, a brand-new dream fluttered into the sky—a dream of flying past planets made of pie, and moons that played music, and soft feathers drifting through galaxies.</p>

    <p>Luna’s lost dream was never really gone. It was just waiting to be dreamed.</p>

    <p>That night, as Bumble yawned one final time and curled up under the star-speckled sky, he whispered:</p>

    <p class="quote">“Sweet dreams, little dreamers… Sleep tight, and may your stars shine bright.”</p>

    <p>And with that, the whole of Starlight Hollow fell into the coziest, sleepiest, dreamiest slumber.</p>

    <p class="end">The End. 🌙✨</p>
