      <h2>The Star That Couldn't Sleep</h2>
      <p>In a sky full of sparkling stars, there lived one tiny star named <strong>Luma</strong>. Every night, the stars twinkled together in harmony, casting their soft glow over sleepy villages and silent forests.</p>

      <p>But Luma was different.</p>

      <p>She couldn't stop shining.</p>

      <p>While the other stars blinked slowly, fading in and out like lullabies in the sky, Luma sparkled so brightly that she kept herself â€” and a few clouds â€” wide awake.</p>

      <p><em>"Why canâ€™t I sleep like the others?"</em> she whispered.</p>

      <p>The Moon, who was wise and kind, drifted closer.  
      <br><em>"Luma, you shine because thereâ€™s a little heart down on Earth who needs your light tonight."</em></p>

      <p>Down below, in a small room with a teddy bear and a nightlight that had just gone out, a little girl named <strong>Mira</strong> was afraid of the dark.</p>

      <p>She clutched her pillow and looked out the window, her eyes wide.</p>

      <p>Then â€” she saw Luma.</p>

      <p><em>"Look, Teddy,"</em> she whispered. <em>"That star is still awakeâ€¦ just like me."</em></p>

      <p>And for the first time, Mira didnâ€™t feel alone.</p>

      <p>She smiled, closed her eyes, and let Lumaâ€™s light lull her to sleep.</p>

      <p>Up in the sky, Luma felt her glow soften â€” not out of worry, but peace.</p>

      <p>She was finally ready to sleep too.</p>

      <p>And so, under the watchful eye of the Moon, both Luma and Mira drifted into dreams â€” one among the stars, the other under them.</p>
